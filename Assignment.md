jA game test is required, mainly focused on testing your skills with clean coding, use of standards, separation of concerns, problem solving and creativity. You should make use of JavaScript and CSS/HTML.

The exercise is to implement a Sliding puzzle game.
Requirements:

- This is a bi-dimensional puzzle (4x4).
- Each piece can move in 4 directions (up, down, left, right).
- At start all pieces are scrambled.
- Movement of a piece is just possible when there is a empty cell next to it.
- Just one movement is possible each time.
- Game ends when all pieces are in the right position, showing the image clearly.
- You are provided with an image to use for the test.
- You can’t use jQuery!
- If you need to use any other framework, please justify why they were used and chosen in the first place.

We think it should take about one or two days to complete. Usually we set a time frame of a week to return the exercise, but if that doesn’t work for you please let us know. It would be great if you can give an indication of how much time you’ve been working on it.

When you are finished, please send us your result in a zipped file via email. Make sure the test is properly built so that it will run directly in the browser with no additional steps.
